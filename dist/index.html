                                        CS 101-02: Beauty and Joy of Computing
                                        Catalog Description
                                        This course presents the history, social implications, great principles, and future of
                                        computing. It examines the computing applications that have changed the world and how
                                        computing empowers discovery and progress in other fields. The relevance of computing to
                                        the student and society will be emphasized. Some students will learn the joy of programming
                                        using a friendly, graphical language, and will complete a substantial programing project. The
                                        course consists of three lecture hours and, for some students, one two-hour laboratory per
                                        week. 3-4 credits. You will also create an e-folio that you will work on throughout the
                                        semester and will use in the other CS courses.
                                        Note: There are some students who will take the lab and some who don’t. Lab and lecture
                                        function independently.
                                        Textbook
                                        You will need an E-subscription to the New York Times which you can get for free at
                                        http://nytimes.com/passes Additional readings will be assigned and put on Moodle. The NYT
                                        articles will change if there are new developments in the field so please check regularly.
                                        Attendance
                                        In class, attendance is highly recommended. You have only 2 unexcused absences. For any
                                        additional unexcused absence, I will deduct 10% from that weekly grade.
                                        Students placed on a mandatory quarantine or in isolation for potential exposure to or con-
                                        traction of Covid may electronically send me documentation showing that they are in one of
                                        those states, and I will teach the respective classes in dual mode. If you attend via Zoom,
                                        your attendance only counts if you have your camera on and are visible on screen (unless you
                                        have a good reason not to that you have previously discussed with me).
                                        Goals and Learning Objectives
                                        CS 101 helps students establish a base upon which to build towards the longer-term goals of
                                        the Computer Science and Cybersecurity programs. The course addresses the following goals
                                        and objectives that have been established by the department:
                                        Goal 1: Discipline Specific Learning
                                        Students will be able to understand and apply the theoretical tools of computer science to
                                        standard problems from the field.

                                        • Students will learn core concepts of the discipline as determined by a nationally
                                        recognized professional computer science education organization.
                                        • Students will understand and analyze algorithms written in pseudo-code.
                                        • Students will identify the various components of a computer-based system and
                                        explain how they integrate to form a coherent solution. Students will document the
                                        components in a style commonly used by software professionals.
                                        Goal 2: Reasoning and Inquiry Skills
                                        Students will be able to read, write, and analyze program fragments and complete programs.
                                        Course web page:
                                        The course material is available on the Moodle site. There is a Moodle page for the course:
                                        CS 101, and a separate Moodle page for the lab: CSL 101. General announcements,
                                        readings, assignments, and laboratory exercises for the course will be given in class AND
                                        published on the Moodle sites. Students are expected to check Moodle regularly for news
                                        and assignment deadlines
                                        Dishonesty Policy
                                        If a student fails to prove that he or she has done work by herself (that is: the student cannot
                                        answer questions about it in class), it has to be re-done. If there is any evidence of plagiarism,
                                        the work will be graded “F”.
                                        After cheating once, the student has to sign a confession that is given to their Dean. Cheating
                                        twice leads to failure of the class.
                                        For the University Policy, please see

                                        Large Language Model (LLM) Policy
                                        Writing is an essential form of critical thinking and problem-solving as well as an ethical
                                        endeavor expressive of the university's values. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
                                        ChatGPT, GPT 4 and Bard are AI-based tools that identify patterns in large collections of
                                        text, culled from various sources including especially webpages on the internet, and then
                                        reproduce those patterns in response to prompts by users. LLMs can generate texts in a very
                                        short amount of time, making it seemingly easier and more efficient to search for and find
                                        summarized information and ideas related to the subject of interest.
                                        However, there are ethical considerations for using them including but not limited to the fact
                                        that their data is taken from writers without reimbursing them, and that they often repeat
                                        racist, sexist, and classist language that one can unfortunately find online. You can also be
                                        kept from critical thinking when using them. For these and other reasons, this is why some
                                        instructors will prohibit any use of LLMs.
                                        I allow the limited use of LLMs. However, if you submit work that makes use of LLMs you
                                        need to do the following:

                                        Office Hours: per appointment
                                        • You need to examine and evaluate the information generated by LLMs, as they may
                                        produce irrelevant or inaccurate information, i.e. hallucinations. You need to check
                                        the source of the information and cite it properly. Texts generated by LLMs, copied
                                        and submitted as your final writing is considered a violation of the university’s
                                        academic honesty policy.
                                        • You should explicitly acknowledge the assistance of LLMs in the creation of your work
                                        (sections or parts that included ideas/issues initially identified via LLMs, or tasks
                                        achieved such as editing and paraphrasing, or calculations).
                                        • When submitting larger works, you should provide an audit trail of queries (for
                                        example, a transcript of queries and responses) and a reflection report/note, as
                                        specified by the instructor.
                                        • I will carefully inspect any texts that are suspected of plagiarism or have been
                                        generated largely by AI, as indicated by detection software. I will make a judgment
                                        on such cases to take the most appropriate action, taking into consideration the
                                        context of the course and the specific assignment.
                                        Title IX
                                        Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights
                                        offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to
                                        offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. If you or
                                        someone you know has been harassed or assaulted, you can find the appropriate resources at

                                        Course Description
                                        This is the first course in the computer science major sequence. The course introduces the object-oriented approach to software design using the programming language Java. Topics covered are software design, implementation and testing, basic computer organization and source code translation. No previous programming experience is presupposed. The course consists of three lecture hours and one two-hour laboratory per week.
                                           1
                                        
                                        Note: The course may not be taken for credit without the laboratory component.
                                        Objectives
                                        Students will be able to design programs using the object-oriented design methodology and will be able to implement and test programs using the object-oriented programming language Java. They will be introduced to the principles of software engineering, in particular the practice of designing large programs using modules, which can be specified, implemented, and tested independently. Students will be able to manipulate the simple and composite data types. They will also be introduced to basic computer organization and data representation at the machine level.
                                        Attendance Policy
                                        A major goal for this course is for students to satisfactorily demonstrate the knowledge, skills and dispositions as described in the course’s objectives. Attendance is critical to achieving those objectives, and it is the students’ responsibility to attend the course on a regular basis.
                                        If you are feeling sick, please do not come to class and follow up (via digital communication) with the instructor to discuss what you missed. If a situation arises in which you must miss multiple lectures, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. Assignment due dates will not be adjusted in response to any absences. Exceptions to this policy may be made on a case-by-case basis when there are extenuating circumstances, however this must be discussed with the instructor before the assignment due date.
                                        Academic Honesty Policy
                                        Enrollment at St. Bonaventure University requires adherence to the University’s standards of
                                        academic
                                        integrity. These standards may be intuitively understood and cannot, in any case, be listed exhaustively.
                                        The following examples, detailed in full in Appendix A of the Code of Conduct (http://www.sbu.edu/codeofconduct), represent some basic types of unacceptable behavior: cheating,
                                        plagiarism, fabrications, obtaining an unfair advantage, aiding and abetting academic dishonesty,
                                        falsification of records and official documents, and unauthorized access to records.
                                        Academic dishonesty is a serious matter and will be dealt with accordingly, with University sanctions ranging from grade alteration to the possibility of expulsion. Students should familiarize themselves with these very important provisions of the Academic Honesty Policy, which is outlined in the Code of Conduct for reference only. Acts of academic dishonesty are not processed through the University Judicial process; the process for handling alleged violations is outlined within the policy.
                                        Students with Disabilities Policy
                                        Students with academic or personal support needs should see Disability Support Services (Plassmann 100D, 375-2065) as soon as possible

                                        Chapter Quizzes
                                        Closed-book quizzes will be given at the end of a unit in-class via Moodle to assess how well you understood the covered material.
                                        Labs
                                        There is a two-hour lab each week. Labs must be submitted via Moodle. Attendance at laboratory sessions is strongly recommended but not required if you can complete the lab on your own equipment. Attending the lab session is the best way to get assistance from your instructor. The labs will all be available at the beginning of the semester and can be re-attempted as many times as you would like. There will be no specific schedule to the labs as far as sessions on Mondays and Wednesdays.
                                        Textbook Assignments
                                        Sections of the online textbook are assigned through the ZyBooks software that pertain to the material being covered in the course. Students are expected to read the sections assigned and complete all the activities in the sections.
                                        Final Project
                                        The final grade for this class is a project that will be assigned in the final weeks of the semester. The final session for our class is scheduled for May 4, 2024 from 1:10 PM – 3:40 PM and will be available to work on your project.
                                        Attendance & Participation
                                        As discussed in the attendance policy above, you are expected to attend class on a regular
                                        basis.
                                        Attendance will be taken at the start of every class.
                                        Absences that are discussed with the instructor will be handled on a case-by-case basis and will have little-to-no impact on your grade.

                                        Course Description: Intermediate-level Spanish grammar with reading, practice in conversation and
                                        language analysis of selected literary texts and cultural materials.
                                        Course Outcomes: This course fulfills Goal One of the Learning outcomes of the Department of World
                                        Languages and Cultural Studies: for the student to be able to understand intermediate concepts in the
                                        target language and be able to better communicate in the language in a variety of daily situations.
                                        Additionally, the student will continue to have an understanding and exposure to various cultural
                                        phenomena and elements of both Latin American and Spanish life. The student will, through a variety of
                                        group and individual work in written, oral and spoken exercises, know the illustrated vocabulary and
                                        grammar of pertinent text chapters. The student will be able to communicate by using the present, past,
                                        and imperfect indicative tenses as well as the present and imperfect subjunctives. The student will also
                                        be able to communicate using the future and conditional tenses as well as a variety of perfect tenses in
                                        both the indicative and the subjunctive. Students will also be able to read and write using the
                                        aforementioned tenses and vocabulary.

                                        Participation (10%):
                                        2
                                        This refers to how much you participate; your attitude toward your fellow classmates, your instructor, and
                                        the activities; your preparedness for the class; and your attendance. All these factors are of paramount
                                        importance: language acquisition is a process, and it is cumulative. Therefore, in order to comprehend
                                        and produce Spanish, you must consistently and actively participate in our class discussions and
                                        activities.
                                        Your class participation will be graded according to the following criteria:
                                        - Superior (90-100%): I attend class every day, arrive on time, and do not leave early. I listen
                                        carefully when others speak and volunteer often. I speak only Spanish. I actively participate with
                                        enthusiasm and a positive attitude in all activities. My presence makes a positive impact on what
                                        we do in class.
                                        - Above-average to average (70-90%): I attend class every day, arrive on time, and do not leave
                                        early. I volunteer occasionally and generally listen to the instructor and others, but sometimes I
                                        get distracted. I speak mostly Spanish in class but use English, too. I show interest and participate
                                        in all activities, sometimes actively, sometimes passively.
                                        - Unsatisfactory (below 70%): I occasionally miss class, and sometimes arrive late or leave early.
                                        I rarely volunteer. I use more English than Spanish in class. I do not pay active attention to
                                        classroom activities. Instead, I do homework, sleep, read the newspaper during class activities. I
                                        am not interested in-class activities.
                                        ATTENDANCE: A major goal for this course is for students to satisfactorily demonstrate the knowledge,
                                        skills, and dispositions as described in the course's objectives. Attendance is critical to achieving those
                                        objectives, and it is the students' responsibility to attend the course as much as they can without putting
                                        themselves, the instructor, or their classmates at risk. Students placed on a mandatory quarantine or in
                                        isolation for potential exposure to or contraction of COVID-19 may electronically send the instructor
                                        documentation showing that they are in one of those statuses, and the instructor will then make
                                        accommodations for those students within the confines of the course objectives.
                                        ATTENDANCE POLICY:
                                        Sickness with documentation, athletics/ROTC, religious observances, and university-sponsored events
                                        are excused absences. Other absences (oversleep/hangover/studying for another class/skipping/family
                                        trips, etc.) are unexcused, and you cannot make up assignments if your absence is unexcused. I will take
                                        attendance using the app "Acadly." No more than three absences will be allowed. After that point, 5
                                        points for each class missed will be deducted from the attendance grade. Two tardies, leaving early or
                                        leaving during class time equals one absence. Six or more unexcused absences will result in a final
                                        grade of an "F."
                                        Electronics Policy:
                                        No texting or cell phone use during class–it is very distracting for everyone. Turn off any and all alerts on
                                        any device. Given the kinds of activities that we will do in this class, the print version of the textbook and
                                        traditional means of note-taking are preferred; however, laptops and tablets may be used in the
                                        classroom for these purposes. Students observed using irrelevant websites or software, or whose
                                        devices distract classmates, will be asked to shut their devices off for the remainder of the class period.
                                        Texting in class or using an electronic device other than to use the eBook will result in a penalty of -5
                                        points.
                                        COVID-19: If we go online to maintain social distancing, you are expected to attend all Zoom meetings
                                        and be on time. You must be prepared for class by having your book open, the camera/microphone on,
                                        and you must be in a professional setting. Please see the "Student Code of Conduct," which outlines all
                                        students' responsibilities as members of the St. Bonaventure University community.
                                        Homework (30%):
                                        SUPERSITE: Extensive homework will be assigned daily – listening, speaking and written activities
                                        assigned in Supersite. Your daily homework assignments will be graded automatically. Late assignments
                                        will not be accepted for credit. You can and should do the Supersite activities as many times as you need
                                        for extra practice and review, including those that aren't assigned. Remember, 30% of your grade is
                                        based on these online workbook assignments. The importance of doing your homework cannot be
                                        3
                                        exaggerated since consistent, daily practice with Spanish is vital to your success! Test items will be
                                        modeled after homework. You have to dedicate about 2 hours a week to the Supersite.
                                        Film (10%):
                                        During the semester, a film from the Spanish-speaking world will be assigned. You will need to watch the
                                        movie and answer questions related to the main themes of the movie.
                                        Exams (40%):
                                        These will closely reflect the activities that you do in and out of class. There will be sections on oral and
                                        reading comprehension, as well as sections on the vocabulary, grammar, and cultural content of the
                                        chapter. All exams must be taken at their scheduled times. The best preparation for these exams will be
                                        your daily active participation in activities during and outside of class. No make-up exams will be given
                                        without written proof of an emergency.
                                        Final Exam (10%):
                                        The final exam will only cover Chapter 11. December 12, 2024: 1:10 PM- 3:40 PM

                                        Course Learning Objectives
                                        Identify characteristics of a community and how they apply to St. Bonaventure.
                                        Analyze and critique a common experience such as film, book, or lecture. 
                                        Explain effective learning strategies and skills, and demonstrate ways these strategies fit with their Bonaventure experience.
                                        Identify and evaluate concepts of well-being and life balance.
                                        Articulate degree requirements, policies, and procedures.
                                        Demonstrate technology and information literacy by articulating the ways that computers process and organize data, how information can be responsibly obtained and protected, and the overall impact of technology on society.
                                        Evaluate personal insights on strengths, informed decision making, and emotional intelligence -and their relevance to life decisions such as life goals and vocation selection and preparation.
                                        Increase awareness and understanding of diversity: students will know basic concepts of diversity and how these they intersect and impact individuals and society. 
                                        Foster social justice: students will know how SBU promotes social justice and addresses issues related to diversity such as discrimination, prejudice, and inequality in our community.
                                        
                                        Academic Honesty:  Academic dishonesty is inconsistent with the moral character expected of students in a University committed to the spiritual and intellectual growth of the whole person and with the ethics of the teaching profession. It also subverts the academic process by distorting all measurements. It is a serious matter and will be dealt with accordingly. A list of unacceptable practices, penalties to be assigned, and procedures to be followed in prosecuting cases of alleged academic dishonesty may be found in the Student Code of Conduct. Students should familiarize with these very important provisions.
